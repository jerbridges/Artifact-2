  I have included as my artifact of algorithms and data structures, an authentication system program for a pretend zoo. The project was developed originally in Java in September 2018, but through enhancement, converted it to a Python program.  This artifact is a good example of understanding how to break down languages and then convert them into another language.  The course objectives were met with this artifact. I found the process enlightening.  Python language is much less verbose and less complex than Java.  There are less imports required by the Python language.  It requires a certain amount of research to figure out how to implement reading and writing to a file.  One interesting part of the programming involved the class requirement from the original project.  The process of implementing and initializing classes with python is much easier.  The class does not have to be constructed like it does with Java classes.   I found that the enhancement reinforced that Python coding is more popular today because it has less requirements than other coding languages and is more simplistic.
